                <p>So, where to start?</p>
                <p>I'm not often told the details of our past projects - I came in after the outpost outside Justice was built. But from what I know, we're here to help. Trying to stabilize the area, physically and socially.</p>
                <p>Things were pretty normal up until a few weeks ago. The activity outdoors ramped up as a wave of new arrivals came - seemingly from nowhere. That train hasn't worked in years.</p>
                <p>It culminated in something unprecedented - an entity nearing the town's center. Forces were immediately dispatched with emergency weaponry - and that was it. The team is missing - presumed dead. The entity is gone. But most importantly, the sun hasn't risen since.</p>
                <p>We keep noticing odd behavior. Initially, it was isolated to a few individuals and attributed to some sort of cabin fever. But it got worse, and we did our best to inform people. We'll see how well that works.</p>
                <p>And now, we're getting readings from far-off areas. It seems that these events aren't just happening here.</p>
                <p>The administration isn't doing anything. I haven't heard anything from headquarters since we found those signals. It's just us.</p>
