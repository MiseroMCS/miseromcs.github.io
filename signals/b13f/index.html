                <p>This video was in an archive directory labelled "Mementos". Looks like security camera footage.</p>
                <p>A woman stands in a plowed field, holding a sack. She pulls up vegetables and places them in the sack, moving along the rows.</p>
                <p>Off camera, a man speaks.</p>
                <p><b>Man:</b> Do you remember my old dog, Pepper?</p>
                <p>The woman looks up and laughs.</p>
                <p><b>Woman:</b> How could I forget? She tackled me when I tried to climb through your window.</p>
                <p><b>Man:</b> They were love taps, Mary. You know she'd never hurt a soul.</p>
                <p><b>Woman:</b> You've got me there. Pepper was a good dog. Why do you ask?</p>
                <p><b>Man:</b> I was just thinking, there was nothin' more important to me than that dog some days. Luisa should get to have that, too.</p>
                <p>The woman laughs again.</p>
                <p><b>Woman:</b> Oh, you always were good at appealing to me. Alright, what kind?</p>
                <p>The video feed cuts out.</p>
